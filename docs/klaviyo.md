## How to find your public API Key and create a private API Key for Klar

1. Go to https://www.klaviyo.com/login and login with the account you want to connect to Klar as a datasource. In case you're logging in with a new device Klaviyo will send you a 6-digit verification code to your registered email address. Please copy and paste that code into the form field and click 'Log in'.
